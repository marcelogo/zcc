## Stress test
In order to ensure the evaluation criteria 4 (_Performance - should gracefully handle a significant increase in amount of data provided (e.g 10000+ users)_) is covered the test
`SearchAppPerformanceTest` runs an integration test using  a data source with 100K users.
Indexing and 100,000 search commands have run under 35 seconds.  

## Assumptions and Trade-offs

 - All entity ids and complex types (Date, Timezone, Locale) have been taken as `Strings` to simplify the implementation
 - It is not required to search for multiple words at the same time.
 - Search for values is case sensitive
 - Search for spaces is not supported
 - Data does not change. Once data has been indexed the source data will not change.
 - Null values and empty strings are indexed the same way
